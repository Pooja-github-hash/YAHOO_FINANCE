Yahoo Finance Dataset Analysis and Visualization

Step 1: Project Overview
  
This project aims to analyze and visualize financial data from the Yahoo Finance dataset. The key objectives include exploring stock price trends, calculating moving averages, analyzing trading volumes, and making predictions based on historical data.

Step 2: Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. These columns represent the stock's price data and trading volume for each date.

Step 3: Install Dependencies
To start the analysis, you need to install the required Python libraries. Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Step 4: Data Preprocessing
Prepare the data by handling any missing values and converting the Date column to a datetime format. This step ensures that the data is ready for time series analysis.

Step 5: Data Visualization
Create visualizations to gain insights into the dataset:

Use a line plot to visualize the trend of the stock's closing price over time.
Plot the trading volume to see how it changes over time.
Compute and plot moving averages of the closing prices to identify trends.
Perform a correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, such as Open, Close, and Volume.
Step 6: Calculate Moving Averages
Calculate the moving averages (e.g., 7-day) for the closing price. Plot these moving averages alongside the actual closing prices to observe long-term trends.

Step 7: Prediction
Use machine learning models to predict the stock's price movement in the next week. Train your model on historical data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy.

Step 8: Run the Analysis
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis. The notebook will guide you through each step, from data loading to visualization and prediction.

Step 9: Review Results
Interpret the results to gain insights into stock price trends, trading volumes, moving averages, and the predictions made by the model.

Step 10: Conclusion and Future Work
Summarize your findings and consider future enhancements, such as experimenting with different models, analyzing more stocks, or developing trading strategies based on your predictions.
